St. Louis’ new Major League Soccer  stadium is planned for land just west of Union Station, along Market Street. When it’s complete in 2022, St. Louis will have three major league stadiums — Busch Stadium, Enterprise Center, and the MLS stadium — all in a row, within about a mile of each other. So we wondered, how common is that? Do other cities have “stadium districts”? Or, is it more likely that pro sports stadiums are spread apart?

To find out, we looked at the 152 teams across the five major professional sports leagues in North America — MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL and NHL. These teams play across 50 metro areas. About half of those have at least three pro sports stadiums currently built or at least planned to be constructed soon. Then, we found the three stadiums in each metro area that are closest together.

The distances vary considerably — Philadelphia and Detroit both have three stadiums within less than a half mile of each other. Compare that to Kansas City, where nearly 20 miles separates Sporting KC’s MLS stadium in Kansas from the two-stadium complex in the city’s eastern suburbs where the baseball and football teams play.

With the completion of the new MLS stadium, St. Louis will rank sixth on the list. Busch Stadium and the proposed MLS stadium are about 1.1 miles apart, with Enterprise Center almost exactly in the middle.
