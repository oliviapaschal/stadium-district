step: 2
text: If you draw the smallest circle possible to fit all three inside, then measure the diameter of that circle, you get 1.13 miles. In this case, that's the distance between Busch Stadium and the new MLS stadium.

step: 3

[+hed]
St. Louis’ new Major League Soccer stadium is planned for land just northwest of Union Station, across Market Street. When it’s complete in 2022, St. Louis will have three major league stadiums[a] — Busch Stadium, Enterprise Center, and the MLS stadium — all in a row, within about a mile of each other. 

So we wondered, how common is that? Do other cities have “stadium districts”? Or, is it more likely that pro sports stadiums are spread apart?

To find out, we looked at the 152 teams across the five major professional sports leagues in North America — MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL and NHL. These teams play across 50 metro areas. About half of those [b]have at least three pro sports stadiums currently built or at least planned to be constructed soon. Then, we found the three stadiums in each metro area that are closest together.[c]

The distances vary considerably — Philadelphia and Detroit both have three stadiums within less than a half mile of each other. Compare that to Kansas City, where nearly[d] 20 miles separates Sporting KC’s MLS stadium in Kansas from the two-stadium complex in the city’s eastern suburbs where the baseball and football teams play.

With the completion of the new MLS stadium, St. Louis will rank sixth on the list. Busch Stadium and the proposed MLS stadium are about 1.1 miles apart, with Enterprise Center almost exactly in the middle.[e]

[Hear Wayne Pratt interview Washington University Sports Business Program Director Patrick Riche about the logic behind locating sports stadiums near each other](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/pro-soccer-hockey-baseball-all-within-mile-what-it-means-downtown-st-louis)

[]

text: Seattle currently has three active major league teams playing in two stadiums. (The Seahawks and Sounders FC share CenturyLink Field.) But the city still makes our list thanks to the NHL, which has awarded Seattle an expansion team for its 2021-22 season. The team will play in the revamped Seattle Center Arena, the former home of the NBA’s Supersonics, near the Space Needle and a few miles northwest of downtown. T-Mobile Park and CenturyLink Field are on the south side of downtown.[l]

How close are they in St. Louis terms?

close: T-Mobile Park and CenturyLink Field are about as close as the Arch’s legs[m]. Seattle’s new NHL arena will be about as far away from those stadiums as it is from the I-64/40 and I-44/55 interchange south to the Anheuser-Busch Brewery.[n]

[a]optional hyphenation here on "major-league stadiums," I'd say
[b]perhaps add in "areas" just so it's clear the "those" isn't in reference to teams, but metro areas
[c]or "which three stadiums in each metro area are closest together."
[d]I see more than 20 miles, from 22-24; though that could be interstate and you could mean pure distance?
[e]I would say Enterprise is actually much closer to the MLS site than the middle of the MLS site and Busch. The way that the roads are makes it about half a mile, but the distance itself can't be more than .2-.3 miles
[f]awesome
[g]classically Texas
[h]or simply "The NHL's Minnesota Wild play about 8 miles..."
[i]replaced: 
The Wild, Minnesota’s NHL team, play in St. Paul, about 8 miles away. Minnesota United FC, the MLS team, play between the Twin Cities.

I replaced it because Minneapolis and St. Paul share city borders. It's just that their downtowns are separated.
[j]Tweaked this to say its in Maryland and to name the team. I found the wording confusing without mentioning who plays at the stadium.
[k]tweaked sentence to add when the team will start playing in the MLS
[l]replaced: 
Initially Seattle didn’t make the list although it currently has three major league teams. The Sounders and Seahawks share a field. But the NHL has awarded the city a hockey team, and they’re planning an arena. T-Mobile Park and CenturyLink Field are next to each other, while the NHL arena is planned for a few miles northwest, near the Space Needle.

Made the change in an attempt to clarify the three-teams-but-two-stadiums language. I also thought the Supersonics detail was interesting.
[m]Replaced: are within an Arch-length
[n]I found this comparison hard to visualize — we've been doing a lot of I-64/40 comparisons. Are there any along that route that compare nicely?
[o]but yet half of the stadium, or more, is little more than a decade old. an example of facadism, really
[p]could cut
[q]Adding Oakland into this, a la, Minneapolis-St. Paul
[r]Replaced:

Prior to Atlanta’s baseball team leaving for the suburbs in 2017, Atlanta’s three stadiums were within a couple miles of each other. Now SunTrust Park is about ten miles northeast.
[s]slightly reworded
[t]the Nashville Sounds, though, represent!
[u]replaced:
